    <h1>Cloud Computing: An Overview</h1>
</header>

<section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Cloud computing refers to delivering computing services—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics—over the internet (“the cloud”). This technology eliminates the need for physical hardware, allowing users to access resources on demand, scale quickly, and reduce operational costs. Organizations and individuals increasingly rely on cloud computing for its flexibility and efficiency.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Types of Cloud Computing</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="box">
            <h3>Public Cloud</h3>
            <p>The public cloud is a shared platform managed by third-party providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. Resources are shared among multiple clients, making it cost-effective. Businesses use public clouds for web hosting, development, and testing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h3>Private Cloud</h3>
            <p>Private clouds are dedicated to a single organization and provide enhanced security and control. They can be hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider. Large enterprises and industries like healthcare often choose private clouds for regulatory compliance.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h3>Hybrid Cloud</h3>
            <p>A hybrid cloud combines public and private clouds, enabling businesses to use both resources based on their needs. It provides the flexibility to manage sensitive data privately while leveraging the scalability of the public cloud.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
